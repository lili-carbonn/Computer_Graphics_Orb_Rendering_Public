# Computer_Graphics_Orb_Rendering_Public

This project demonstrates a 3D sphere that can animate along a curve path using WebGL. The sphere can be rendered with different lighting modes (lit or wireframe) and shading modes (flat or Phong).

## Features

- Interactive 3D sphere rendering with WebGL
- Curve-based animation path using Chaikin's corner cutting algorithm
- Multiple lighting modes (lit or wireframe)
- Multiple shading modes (flat or Phong)
- Camera controls for viewing the scene from different angles
- Light position controls for dynamic lighting effects
- Adjustable subdivision levels for both the sphere and the curve

## Controls

- **W/S**: Orbit camera up/down
- **A/D**: Orbit camera left/right
- **Q/E**: Zoom camera in/out
- **Arrow Keys**: Move light position (with Shift: move light forward/backward)
- **J/K**: Decrease/Increase sphere subdivision level
- **G/H**: Increase/Decrease curve subdivision level
- **A**: Toggle animation
- **M**: Toggle lighting mode (lit/wireframe)
- **L**: Toggle shading mode (flat/Phong) when in lit mode

## Technologies Used

- WebGL for 3D rendering
- JavaScript for application logic
- GLSL for shader programming

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser that supports WebGL
3. Use the keyboard controls to interact with the scene
